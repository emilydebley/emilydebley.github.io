If you have time to wonder such things, if you are so privleged as to not hear the screams of your neighbors being holed from next door, then you may still have time. Time to hug your loved ones. Time to say goodbye.</p></div>

            <p id="content">This is so sensationalist, calling a few reports of shrimp in a minority of towns an "invasion" is absurd.</p>

            <p id="content">Very tragic what happened in the southern states. If the shrimp can be convinced we're peaceful like the president says i think we can show them reason. They won't attack people if they arn't a clear threat so don't shoot at them!</p>
